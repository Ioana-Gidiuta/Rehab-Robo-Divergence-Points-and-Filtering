# Infant Movement Analysis and Tracking – Summer 2025 Research

This repository contains code and experiments for analyzing and tracking infant movement patterns.  
The project explores two main research directions:

- **Filtering methods** for optimal trajectory smoothing  
- **Optimal control approaches** for identifying divergence points in infant development
